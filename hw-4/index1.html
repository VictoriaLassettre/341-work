    <h4>Directions</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Grease a 9 x 9" pan with butter. Dust with flour and tap out the excess. Preheat the oven to 350Â°.</li>
          <ul>Melt the butter and chocolate chips in a small pan over low heat, stirring frequently. Remove from the heat and cool before mixing in the peppermint extract.</ul>
        <li>Cream the eggs, sugar, and vanilla together in a large bowl until smooth. Add the cooled chocolate mixture and mix until well blended.</li>
        <li>Measure the flour and salt and then sift together directly into the batter. Mix gently until well combined and no trace of the dry ingredients remains. Stir in the mint chips, if desired, and mix well.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and top with the sugar sprinkles if desired. Bake for 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean or with only crumbs, not batter, on it.
Remove from the oven and let cool for one hour. Cut just before serving. Makes 12 to 16 brownies.</li>
