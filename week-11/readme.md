# Week 11 Write Up

### Victoria Lassettre

## Summary
- So I read the lecture and the required readings last week and created the files needed for this week's assignment.
- For this particular assignment I chose to do a quick informational thing on Austria as I am currently planning a trip to the country.
- Unfortunately, due to when I started this week's project I did not get to do everything I originally wanted, but hopefully in the final project I will have the opportunity to do so.

## Trials and Tribulations:
- As usual time management and making sure my tags are correct were the biggest things I struggled with.

## Future Plans:
- I have my idea for the final project and I am excited to see if I can pull it off successfully!
