The article “Community Acquired Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Carrying Panton-Valentine Leukocidin Genes: Worldwide Emergence” by François Vandenesch et al., defines community acquired Staphylococcus aureus as a strain obtained outside of a hospital or assisted living setting. This article looked at possible links between Community-Acquired Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) and Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL), a cytotoxin released in MRSA (Vandenesch, Naimi, Enright, Lina, Nimmo, Heffernana, Liassine, Bes, Greenland, Reverdy, and Etienne, 2003).
