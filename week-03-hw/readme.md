# Week 3 Report
  Victoria Lassettre
## Homework Steps

- Read the online notes and text--learned about things such as <title>, <h1>, and </h2>.
- Created an index.html
- Edited the index.html with the inital comments; figured out what happens when you forget to close the tag properly by forgetting the /.
- Formatted a sonnet I wrote two years ago on my first webpage. I fiddled around added colors to my webpage.
- Successfully pushed the page to my repository and managed to pull up the correct link from my url.

## Problems/Aha Moments

- I think I have finally figured out SourceTree and GitHub and feel less like an idiot when working with the two.

## Looking Ahead

- I am looking forward to learning more about formatting webpages; including things such as styles, colors, and placements of text and images.

## Helping

- As of right now I have not helped anyone with an issue, but that may change by the end of the week.
