  <h1><center>The History of Chocolate</center></h1>
  <center><img src="./imgs/Chocolate.jpg" title="Food of the Gods" alt="Chocolate" width="350" height="225"/></center>
  <p>Originally consumed in Latin America by the Mayans and Aztecs, chocolate was brought to Spain by Christopher Columbus in 1502. It did not pick up popularity though, until 1528 when Hernan Cortes brought it back after his conquest of Latin America. The Spanish managed to keep the cocoa beans hidden from the rest of Europe until 1579 when English pirates ransacked a Spanish ship carrying the beans. The drink created from cocoa grew in popularity across Europe thatnks to Princess Anne d'Autriche who brought it with her to her marriage to King Louis XIII.</p>
  <p>In the mid-1700s, thanks to the Industrial Revolution, the process to create chocolate was revolutionized. Inventions include a hydraulic machine, a steam-driven chocolate mill, and most importantly the cocoa press. The cocoa press, created by Coenraad Van Houten in 1829, could squeeze out the cocoa butter leaving today's cocoa powder. Van Houten also added alkaline salts to the powered chocolate which mellowed the sharp flavor of chocolate and made it easier to mix with water. Thanks to the ability to remove the cocoa butter, chocolatiers were able to manipulate what type of chocolate they were making, whether it be white, milk, or dark chocolate.</p>
