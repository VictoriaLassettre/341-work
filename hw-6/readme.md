# Week 7 Write up
## Victoria Lassettre

### Summary
- I read the lecture and the book readings and then created this week's directory.
- I then created the initial `index.html` and the various other pages needed to create the full site for this week's design.
- The `index2.html` and `index3.html` pages were made first along with the `imgs`. The `questionnaire`,`contact.html`, `video.html` and `video2.html` were all created at once after the first page was set up.

### Troubles and Tribulations
- Honestly just the time management for this week's assignment was the hardest as it required so much more time than the past assignments.
### Looking to the Future
- I am looking forward to continue on learning about how to modify the page further and make it on par with the websites/pages we use on a daily basis.
