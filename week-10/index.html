  <p>Responsive Web Design or RWD is an approach that enables a website to look well put together no matter what type of technology one is using--whether it be a smartphone or a laptop.</p>

  <center><h2>Why should designers use it?</h2></center>
  <p>In today's world people don't use just one type of technology to view the internet like they did before the rise of smartphones, meaning web developers need to ensure that the site looks good on whatever platform a potential viewer is using. Additionally they need to make sure that the mobile version looks just as good as the computer version as an unsightly website can drive traffic away and lose an audience.</p>
  <div id="box-3">
    <center><h3>The importance of RWD</h3></center>
    <center><p>It ensures that the website can keep up with the changing times as technology progresses and screen sizes change as well along with the amount of pixels that are used within the screens as well. Like with all things we must prepare for the next generation so that today's technology doesn't become completely obsolete why we still are using it.
