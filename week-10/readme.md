# Week 10 Write-Up
#### Victoria Lassettre
## Summary
- After completing all of the reading and creating the `index.html`, `readmd.md`, `CSS Folder`, and the `imgs Folder` with all of their respective files.
- The goal of this week's website was to explain why Responsive Web Design is ever important in today's ever changing times.
## Troubles
- Didn't have too many problems that weren't easily fixable, but did have a bit of a hard time trying to figure out what type of layout I wanted to use.
## Commentary
- I just hope that I have enough time to finish my final project as we still haven't gotten the instructions yet and I--like several others--have other large projects to finish before the end of term.
