  <h5>A General History of Austria</h5>
  <p>Austria was originally formed from nomadic tribes dating back from the Paleolithic Age (about 8000 BC). In 996 AD the term Ostarrichi was used for the first time--the predecessor to Ã–sterreich the current German word for Austria. It was then controlled by the Babenberg dynasty and it was in 1100s when the capital Vienna--or Wien--was established. Ultimately the Babenberg dynasty and gave rise to the last dynasty of Austria: the Habsburgs.</p>

<h2>The Last Dynasty of Austria: the Habsburgs</h2>
<p>Founded by Kaiser Rudolf I, the Habsburg dynasty ruled for 640 years until the death of Kaiser Franz Joseph I in 1916, and then the First Republic of Austria was established in 1918. The Habsburg rose to power thanks to their tactical marriage arrangements and their alliance with Poland, Venic, and Russia in the Turkish Wars. During their reign there was a marked change in society as the Zeitgeist changed and urbanization and industrialization became a central part of life. The final emperor, Kaiser Franz Joseph and his wife, Elisabeth "Sisi"--until her assasination in 1898--forged a strong front for Vienna as an epicenter for culture and metropolitan life. They also forged an alliance with Hungary creating the Austro-Hungarian Empire.</p>
