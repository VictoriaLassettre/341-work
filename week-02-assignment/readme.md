# Week 2 Report
Victoria Lassettre

## 1. Homework Cycle

- After doing my initial readings for the course I then downloaded both Sourcetree and Atom. I chose these two systems as the course uses these particular ones and I knew I had a better chance of finding help from my peers if need be.

- I then went back through the directions for each of the tasks (as I have no background in web design or development), such as test1.txt and learning how to commit items to a repository.

- If I found a problem with how to do something I turned to the lesson videos such as: [Working With Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fZ-QCl7HC8) and [Text Editor & Atom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gbq9ZWXtyK4)

## 2. Steps for completing the assignments this week
1. Downloaded Atom and Sourcetree
2. Installed the recommended packages from the course
3. Finished and placed the text1.rtf.txt in my 341-work fold after creating it.
4. After opening test1.txt in Atom new text was added
5. Created a new repository and created a new directory in my GitHub account.
6. Then the test1.rtf.txt was committed using the following command:
`
git commit -m 'initial commit for the repository and test1.rtf.txt'
`

## 3. Problems

- I honestly didn't have too many problems and were easily solved by going back over the material covered in the lectures or a quick google search.

## 4. Something Interesting
- Nothing in particular, but as a complete beginner in the world of web development any further discussion in the use of markdown in Atom or other TextEditors would be appreciated.
## 5. Helping Peers
- Unfortunately I did not help any of my classmates with the work presented in this homework cycle.
